\<Apex Scientist 1\> We saved you young one, you are in our lab.

Where... are they? My caretakers?

\<Apex Scientist 2\> They didnt make it.

\<Apex Scientist 1\> they accidentally expanded their village into hylotl territory. they broke the treaty.

\<Group of florans, lead by one with large wooden antlers> *muffled speech*

\<Apex Scientists> *muffled speach*

i think they are negotiating something, either way the scientists come back with some fresh meat for me. this seems to be happening more commonly.

*they have been warning me against the florans. why would they be doing this? Maybe they dont want me with my own kind... but why?*

---
I did it. i escaped their cultish ways. now to escape them...

---
*blood dripping from mouth* *heavy breathing* i made it, i made it out. but at what cost? the lives of those who raised me. i best get out of here before the guards come. i am going to start looking for them. maybe they can show me what i have never been able to learn.

---
i found them. my search is over. i made a ship from some scraps i found and vines,  and i found them, they say they are from the ramfar, and i think they will help me. i guess this is where my adventure begins.
